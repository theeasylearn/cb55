what is data structure?
data structure means mechanism to store and retrive/process the data in specific manner as per the requirement. 
there are so many different types of data structure used in computer science field. to name few 

1) Stack 
2) Queue 
3) Circular Queue 
4) Double ended queue 
5) Binary Tree 

Stack 
-----------------------
Stack is one type of data structure in which all the items(value) are inserted and removed only from one end which top end. stack is one type of LIFO data structure. LIFO means Last in first out. in stack, insert operation is called push operation and remove operation is call pop operation.  if stack if full then we can not push new value and it is called overflow operation. and if stack is empty & we try to remove value from it then it is called underflow operation. stack can be implemented either using an array or using Linked list. 


Queue
------------------------------------
Queue is one type of data structure in which all items(values) are inserted at one end (rear end) and all items are removed from another end(front end). if queue is full then we can not insert new item into queue which is known queue overflow. if queue is empty and if we try to remove item from queue, item can not be removed and it is called queue underflow. queue can be implemented using array or Linked list. queue is FIFO data structure. FIFO means First In First Out
